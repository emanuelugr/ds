\section{Planification of Software tests}
\subsection{Race Selection}

\textbf{Test:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Select each valid race (Elfo, Enano, Humano, Orco) from the available options.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
This test verifies that the application properly recognizes and processes user selections for character race. It ensures characters can be created with intended racial attributes.

\subsection{Class Selection}

\textbf{Test:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Select each valid class (Caballero, Ladrón, Mago, Ranger) from the available options.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
Similar to race selection, this test ensures the application handles class selection correctly. It guarantees characters can be created with the functionalities associated with their chosen class. 

\subsection{Character Name}

\textbf{Test:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enter a valid character name.
    \item Leave the character name field empty.
    \item Enter a character name with a really long name
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
This test verifies the application allows valid character naming and handles empty or excessively long names appropriately. Testing empty and long names helps identify potential issues like crashes or errors when a user doesn't provide a name or exceeds the limit.

\subsection{Character Creation}

\textbf{Test:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a character with valid selections for race, class, and name.
    \item Attempt to create a character with missing selections .
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
This test confirms the core functionality of the application: creating characters based on user selections. It ensures characters are created as intended. Testing with missing selections helps identify potential bugs or incomplete functionalities if required fields are left empty.

\subsection{Character List Filtering}

\textbf{Test:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Filter characters by each available race.
    \item Filter characters by each available class.
    \item Filter characters by both race and class.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
This test verifies the functionality of the character list filtering system. It ensures users can effectively search and find characters based on specific criteria.

\subsection{Character List Sorting}

\textbf{Test:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sort characters by name.
    \item Sort characters by race.
    \item Sort characters by class.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation:}\\
This test verifies the functionality of the character list sorting system. It ensures users can organize their characters based on different criteria for easier browsing.

    \subsection{Character Details Screen}
        \textbf {Test:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Create a character and navigate to its details screen.
            \item Verify that the displayed details (name, race, class, attributes) match the created character's information.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \textbf {Explanation:}\\
         This test confirms that the application correctly retrieves and displays information for a selected character. It ensures users can access and review the details of their creations.

    
    \subsection{Character Deletion} 
    
        \textbf{Test:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Create a character.
            \item Delete the created character from the list
            \item Verify that the character is removed from the list and cannot be accessed anymore.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \textbf{Explanation:}\\ 
        This test verifies the functionality of character deletion. It ensures users can manage their character collection and remove unwanted characters.It's also important to check for proper handling during deletion, such as confirmation prompts to avoid accidental character loss.
